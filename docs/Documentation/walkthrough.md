# Walkthrough - Documentation Update

I have updated the repository documentation to make it more presentable for public viewing.

## Changes

- **LICENSE**: Added a standard MIT License.
- **README.md**: Completely rewrote the README to include:
  - Project Title & Badges
  - Description in English and Japanese
  - **Link to the live Demo**
  - Key Features list
  - Tech Stack details
  - Installation instructions

## Verification

- **Visual Check**:
  - Open [README.md](file:///c:/dev_Bunpu/Bunpu/README.md) to preview the Markdown content.
  - Visit the [GitHub Repository](https://github.com/RyuU12358/Bunpu) to see the rendered README (after push).
